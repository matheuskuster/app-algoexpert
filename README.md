# Description

AlgoExpert's Mobile App was developed using Facebook's <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native">React Native</a> framework and <a href="https://expo.io/">Expo tools</a>. It's objective is to deliver almost the same experience of using the platform at a web browser. The user can do the same things, except coding. But to compensate it, the app brings some new features, as favorite questions.
